Data Quality
Footnotes,"NH = non-Hispanic; “Other, NH” race includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and Multiple or Other races; Vaccination coverage represents the total number of pregnant people who received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, including either first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson Janssen vaccine, during pregnancy. Please refer to the following MMWR for more information on methods: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e2.htm *Vaccine Safety Datalink is a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations in seven U.S. states; eight sites provide data and one additional site provides subject matter expertise. For more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html. Cumulative vaccination data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink were first reported to CDC on March 13, 2021, and included vaccines administered since December 14, 2020; thus, data reported during December 14, 2020–March 12, 2021, could not be shared by week. Please note that the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rates for pregnant people reported on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker changed from a cumulative estimate of pregnant persons receiving at least one dose of COVID vaccine to a weekly estimate of those who were fully vaccinated on January 20, 2022. The cumulative data included the vaccination status of all individuals who were identified as pregnant anytime since December 2020, when COVID-19 vaccines were first authorized under emergency use. Even if the individuals were no longer pregnant or included in the Vaccine Safety Datalink system, they remained part of the denominator. Additionally, for those pregnant people who did not get a vaccine between December 2020 and April 2021 – a time when vaccine eligibility was limited and some populations were prioritized – they were counted in the cumulative data as unvaccinated, lowering the coverage rates.
