Footnotes,"NH = non-Hispanic; “Other, NH” race includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and Multiple or Other races. *Vaccine Safety Datalink(VSD) is a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and nine integrated health care organizations in seven U.S. states; eight sites provide data and one additional site provides subject matter expertise. For more information please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html. Figure : Up to date is defined as the percent of pregnant people who received an updated bivalent dose before or during pregnancy, with the denominator including those pregnant at least 1 day during the specified month ending date, and the numerator including those who received an updated bivalent dose. Data is updated the first Wednesday of each month and includes vaccinations reported to CDC through the Saturday prior to the first Wednesday of each month. Therefore, there may be some overlap with data being included from the beginning of the reporting month. For example, data update on June 7, 2023, included vaccinations reported through Saturday, June 3, 2023."
