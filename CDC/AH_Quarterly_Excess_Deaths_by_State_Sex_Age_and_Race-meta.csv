Footnotes,"Both unweighted and weighted (predicted) provisional counts are provided. Weighting of provisional counts is done to account for potential underreporting in the most recent time periods. However, data for the most recent time periods are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death. The completeness of provisional data varies by cause of death and by age group. However, the weights applied do not account for this variability. Therefore, the predicted numbers of deaths may be too low for some age groups. For example, provisional data on deaths among younger age groups is typically less complete than among older age groups. Predicted counts may therefore be too low among the younger age groups. Numbers in 2020 and 2021 are compared with the average numbers from the same quarters in 2015-2019. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm and https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/tech_notes.htm."
