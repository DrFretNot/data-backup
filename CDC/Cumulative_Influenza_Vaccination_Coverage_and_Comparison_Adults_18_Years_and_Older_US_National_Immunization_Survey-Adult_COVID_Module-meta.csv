Footnotes,"*Some estimated percentages may not meet the NCHS standards of reliability; if none of the percentages within a bar meet these standards, the bar will not be presented. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdfpdf icon ^Estimates with a sample size < 30 are suppressed and shown in gray on the map. For the map, the ‘Other/Multiple Races, Non-Hispanic’ category includes American Indian/Alaskan Native, non-Hispanic, Asian, non-Hispanic, Pacific-Islander/Hawaiian Native, non-Hispanic, and persons who selected ‘Other’ and multiple races. Therefore, the ‘Other/Multiple Races, Non-Hispanic’ jurisdiction-level estimates on the map should not be compared with the ‘Other/Multiple Races, Non-Hispanic’ national estimates in the table."
