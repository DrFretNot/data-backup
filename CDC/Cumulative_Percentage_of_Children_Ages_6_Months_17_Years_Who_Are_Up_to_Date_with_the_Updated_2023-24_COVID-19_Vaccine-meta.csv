Suggested Citation,"National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cumulative Percentage of Children 6 Months - 17 Years Vaccinated with the Updated 2023-24 COVID-19 Vaccine, United States"
Geospatial Resolution,"National, Region, State"
Footnotes,"National estimates include 50 states and Washington D.C. The Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs hosts 10 Regional Offices that directly serve state and local organizations; information about Regions and which states are included in each region is available at https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. Up to Date with the updated 2023-24 COVID-19 vaccine is defined as receipt of at least one vaccination since September 14, 2023 for children â‰¥5 years; for children <5 years, up-to-date status was defined based upon the current recommendations that take into account number of doses and brand of vaccine. Vaccine receipt date used for analyses was date of most recent vaccine. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on all interviews through the current week and represent approximately the cumulative percent vaccinated by mid-week. Each week, estimates for prior weeks are recalculated using the additional interviews conducted that week (combined with all previous interviews). Cumulative vaccination coverage estimates are suppressed when the cumulative sample size is <30 or current week sample size is <5. Vaccination intent estimates for a given week are suppressed when the sample size for that week is <30. Confidence Intervals (CI) describe the level of uncertainty around an estimate because a sample was taken. 95% CIs represent the range of values that would result if the data collection had been repeated many times. For a 95% confidence interval, if the sampling method is repeated many times, the true value would fall within this interval at least 95% of the time. Wider CIs reflect larger random error in estimates resulting from survey sampling. Estimates from the NIS may differ from estimates based on other data sources, and in addition to random error associated with taking a sample, are subject to errors resulting from incomplete sample frame (exclusion of households without cell phones), selection bias (survey respondents may be more likely to be vaccinated than non-respondents), and errors in self or parental reported vaccination status. Estimates are weighted to selected sociodemographic characteristics of the U.S. population to reduce possible bias from incomplete sample frame and selection bias. Health insurance status is not available from NIS-Flu and was removed from the list of demographics beginning January 2, 2024."
