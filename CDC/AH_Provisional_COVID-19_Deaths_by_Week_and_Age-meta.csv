Suggested Citation,National Center for Health Statistics. AH Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Week and Age. Date accessed [Last accessed date]. Available from https://data.cdc.gov/d/ikd3-vynf.
Footnotes,"This data file includes the following age groups in addition to the age groups consistent with those used across CDC COVID-19 surveillance pages: 18-49 years, under 65 years, and 65 years and older. When analyzing the file, the user should make sure to select only the desired age groups. Summing across all age categories provided will result in double counting deaths from certain age groups. Number of deaths reported in this table are the total number of deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis, and do not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more."
